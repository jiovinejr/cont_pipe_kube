# 🚀 Sandbox for Containers, CI/CD Pipelines, and Kubernetes

## Overview
This repository serves as a **sandbox environment** for experimenting with:
- 🐳 **Containers** (Docker, Podman)  
- 🔄 **CI/CD Pipelines** (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI)  
- ☸️ **Kubernetes** (Minikube, K3s, Helm)  

The goal is to build a **hands-on learning space** where I can test, break, and refine my understanding of these DevOps technologies.
